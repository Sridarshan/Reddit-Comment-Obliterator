Reddit-Comment-Obliterator
==========================

Deletes all your reddit comments clean. When you delete a comment in reddit, a copy of the comment is still persists in the database. However, when you edit a comment, no comment history is stored. Taking into advantage this fact, we delete all comments by editing the comment to empty before deleting them.
